# MindReaderGame
"The Mind Reader" Program prompts the user to
think of a number within the range of 1 to 63. It displays 
cards containing a set of various numbers, asking the user to
accept or deny if their number is contained in the card set.
After, the user enters their response (Y/N) for each card, the
program will determine the number that the user was thinking of.

- This assembly language program uses bit manipulation to find the players number.
